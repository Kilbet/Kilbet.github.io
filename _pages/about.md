I am a PhD student in the Bender Group of the [Center for Molecular Science Informatics](https://www-cmi.ch.cam.ac.uk), part of the [Department of Chemistry](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge. I am currently pursueing the discovery of new adverse outcome pathways; the causal link of biological events between a drug interacting in the body at a molecular level - the mode of action (MoA), and an adverse outcome (AO) - the phenomenological side effect observed in clinical studies. I utilise in-vivo biological databases and current toxicological knowledge to graphically define a sequence of events, and develop validated computational predictive models (in-vitro) to support the inference between the biological events.
 
My mission is two-fold. Firstly, to I aim to increase our understanding of MoAs, and exploit this to better improve hazard and risk assessments in the pharmaecutical pipeline - reducing drug candicate failures, and allow for a better focus of effort on more promising targets to help patients. Secondly, I aim to contribute to the replacement, refinement, and reduction of animals in research through development of in-vitro analyses - please see the [NC3Rs](https://www.nc3rs.org.uk).
