I am a PhD student in the [Bender Group](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/group/bender/index) of the [Center for Molecular Science Informatics](https://www-cmi.ch.cam.ac.uk), part of the [Department of Chemistry](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge. I am currently pursuing the discovery of new adverse outcome pathways (AOPs); the causal link of biological events, or key events (KEs) between a drug interacting in the body at a molecular level - the molecular initiating event (MIA), and an adverse outcome (AO) - the phenomenological side effect observed in clinical studies. Such understanding yields a drugs mode of action (MoA). I utilise *in-vivo* biological databases and current toxicological knowledge to graphically define a sequence of events, and develop validated computational predictive models (*in-vitro*) to support the inference between the biological events. The current AOP-knowledge base resides in the [AOP-Wiki](https://aopwiki.org).
 
**My mission is two-fold.** Firstly, to I aim to increase our understanding of MoAs, and exploit this to better improve hazard and risk assessments in the pharmaecutical pipeline - reducing drug candicate failures, and allow for a better focus of effort on more promising targets to help patients. Secondly, I aim to contribute to the replacement, refinement, and reduction of animals in research through development of *in-vitro* analyses - please see the [NC3Rs](https://www.nc3rs.org.uk).
